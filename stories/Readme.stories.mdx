# react-highlighter-ts
This is a TypeScript rewrite of the npm package
[`react-highligher`](https://github.com/helior/react-highlighter), which has no
type support, has very out of date dependencies, and seems to be abandoned (no
activity since 2018).


## Usage
The API for this package is identical to that of the original package,
`react-highlighter`.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Highlight } from "react-highlighter-ts";

export const Example = () => (
  <Highlight search="hello">Hello, World!</Highlight>
);
```

### Styling
By default, this library wraps matches in an html `<mark>` tag, and does not
style it. Most browsers style the `<mark>` tag by giving it a yellow background
and black text. You can style your matches by providing a pre-styled
element type to `matchElement`, passing a CSS class to `matchClass`, or passing
CSS rules to `matchStyle`.

### Migrating from `react-highlighter`
You should be able to migrate directly from `react-highlighter` to
`react-highlighter-ts` without any changes in your source code besides adjusting
your imports.
